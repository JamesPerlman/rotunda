My name is James Perlman.  I designed and coded this site.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I strive to achieve the best quality in web design, and find much pleasure in bringing abstract ideas to life.  If you have any feedback whatsoever I would love to hear from you.  Feel free to send me an email..  If you are an employer and you like what you see, I would be honored to be of service.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a work in progress, and an act of shameless self-promotion.  Content will be added and updated, and new features are coming soon.  Thanks for reading this!
